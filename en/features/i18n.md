# Internationalization

From <Badge type="tip" text="v1.2.0" />, `H2O-ac` supports internationalization, which can be controlled by site and page level.

## Field data

All field data for internationalization are stored in `/_data/locales/`. The files are named with the common languages as follows:

| Filename | Language |
| :--: | :--: |
| `zh-Hans.yml` | Simiplied Chinese |
| `zh-Hant.yml` | Traditional Chinese |
| `en.yml` | English |
| `ja.yml` | Japanese |

The supported fields mainly includes `cover`, `panel`, `footer`, `post`, `archives`, `categories` and `langs`. Please refer to [Source Code](https://github.com/zhonger/jekyll-theme-H2O-ac/tree/master/_data/locales) for more details.

## Site config

It's recommended to enable all possible languages and set the most used language for posts to default language.

```yaml
languages: ['zh-Hans', 'zh-Hant', 'en', 'ja']  # The internationalization list
default_lang: 'zh-Hans'  # Default language
```

If you want to write a post or page with a non-default language, please define the language used in meta information of the post or the page. The following is an example with English:

```yaml
lang: en
```

If one post or page has more than one language version, you can define them in meta information to info readers like below:

```yaml
langs: [en, zh-Hans]
```

Because the page with different languages will be generated automatically, the urls for different languages have to follow the rules. Otherwise, a 404 error will happen.

For example, the homepage of default language is `/index.html`ï¼š
- If Simplied Chinese is the default language, the homepage with English will be `/en/index.html`. The homepage with Traditional Chinese will be `/zh-Hant/index.html`.
- If English is the default language, the homepage with Simplied Chinese will be `/zh-Hans/index.html`.

:::warning
- The pages with the default language **could not be accessed with subdirectory**!!!
- If the language used in post or page is not listed in `site.languages`, a 404 error will happen.
