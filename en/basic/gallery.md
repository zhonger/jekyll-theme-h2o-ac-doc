# Gallery and Lazy-loading

`H2O-ac` uses [fancybox](https://fancyapps.com/fancybox) to provide gallery in posts. (Nothing needs to do for users.)

To improvde the experiences for images, `H2O-ac` also uses **lazy-loading** to reduce the number of URL requests.

The default lazy-loading gif is as follows (the gif file locates in `/assets/img/loading.gif`). If you want to change it, please use another file to instead it with the same filename and directory.

![loading.gif](/imgs/loading.gif)

The default 404 image is as follows (it locates in `/assets/img/placeholder.webp`). If you want to change it, please use another file to instead it with the same filename and directory.
