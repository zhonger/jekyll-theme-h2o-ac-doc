# The begining

As you know, **Jekyll** is a highly customizable and very popular static blog generator. There are many excellent themes based on Jekyll, such as [H2O](https://github.com/kaeyleo/jekyll-theme-H2O) theme developed by [Liao Keyu](https://github.com/kaeyleo). It may be one of the most beautiful Jekyll themes due to many features, including *simple layout, flat design, card based design, visual style of Medium and Zhihu* and others.

In the begining, `H2O` theme is released and open sourced in Github with MIT license. This has attracted a lot of bloggers to switch to Jekyll and `H2O` theme, including me. As more and more bloggers use `H2O` theme, some problems and solutions have been contributed to the `H2O` project, which makes `H2O` better. I also modified some codes based on `H2O` theme and my actual need in practice. Considering these modification may be not needed for most of users of `H2O` theme, I forked the `H2O` project and contributed my code to the new project [zhonger/jekyll-theme-H2O-ac](https://github.com/zhonger/jekyll-theme-h2o-ac), which is released in Github with the same MIT license.

In my opinion, the `H2O-ac` theme is designed especially for schloar researchers and web developers (DevOps).

## New features

### Resonable structures

Although `H2O` theme has meet the needs of most users, it still can be promoted in page structures for scholar researchers and web developers.

- For scholar researchers, it's very important to show the personal information and researchers in the homepage. It's something like `About me` page `about.html` but placed in the homepage `index.html`.
- For web developers, it's necessary to archive all posts in one page `archives.html` to find the interesting posts easily. Despite the search function, card list page and tags page in `H2O` theme can show some of the posts, it's still not simple and convenient. The archive page usually generated in hexo or other web static generotor is the best choice.
- Except these, the change log for the blog website is also important for web developers. It can be thought as the history of the blog website from the begining by years, months and events.
- The resume page is also needed for scholar researchers and web developers. It can show the core information for the owner with a beautiful view, and can be printed conveniently.

Therefore, `H2O-ac` theme made a `page` template from origin home page in `H2O`. According to the needs, several pages including **Scholar Homepage** (`index.html`), **Archives** (`archives.html`), **Change logs** (`logs.html`), **CV** (`cv.html`), **Terms of Service** (`tos.html`) and **Links** (`links.html`) have been added based on `page` template.

### Better experience for readers

On the basis of `H2O` theme, `H2O-ac` theme promoted the experience for readers including:
